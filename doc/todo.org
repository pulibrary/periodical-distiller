#+TITLE: TODOs for Princeton Distiller

* Ad Hoc TODOs
** TODO [#C] Consider adding lxml type stubs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: add-lxml-type-stubs
:ASSIGNEES: Claude
:END:

- Motivation :: In [[file:~/repos/gh/pulibrary/periodical-distiller/src/schemas/article.py][article.py]], basedpyright complains that =_Element= is
not known.
- Suggested Action :: Add type hints for lxml using [[https://github.com/lxml/lxml-stubs/blob/master/lxml-stubs/etree.pyi][lxml-stubs]].
** DONE Create Pydantic schema for CEO3 Items
:PROPERTIES:
:ASSIGNEES: Claude
:CUSTOM_ID: create-pydantic-schema-for-ceoitems
:END:

- Motivation :: The CEOClient needs this schema to validate data it
  fetches; other components will use it to access record fields.
